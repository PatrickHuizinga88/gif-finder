My second project in React.

This webapp let's you search, find and share gifs from the internet. Type the keywords into the input and press enter to get a list of gifs that will match your interest. This feature is powered by the Giphy API. When hovering over (desktop) or pressing on (mobile/tablet) a gif, you will be able to share a embed URL of the gif.

I designed and built this webapp by myself and with the help of Google search.
